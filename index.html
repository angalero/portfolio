                    <span>I am a student in my senior/4th year of College at Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, VA, USA. 
                        I expect to graduate in May 2023 with a BA in Theatre and Computer Science. I did a study abroad 
                        experience in Scotland at the University of Stirling and my plan is to go into a Computer Science 
                        related career, starting out in any department because I love to learn the different areas of 
                        Technology and I know various programming languages. I hope to end up in the Game Development 
                        industry as a final career path. </span></td>
